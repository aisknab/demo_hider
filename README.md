# Demo Header Logo Hider

Chrome extension for Criteo demo environments that can:

- Replace header branding (logo, account name, favicon).
- Auto-grab branding assets from the active retailer tab.
- Convert displayed USD amounts (values prefixed with `$`) into selected currencies.

Changes are client-side only and do not modify backend data.

## Supported pages

- `https://criteo.com/*`
- `https://*.criteo.com/*`

## Features

- `Replace logo` toggle.
- `Replace account name` toggle.
- `Replace favicon` toggle (when logo replacement is enabled).
- Retailer name override.
- Custom logo upload.
- Custom favicon upload.
- Auto-grab branding from active tab (name, logo, favicon).
- Currency selector with grouped options: `US`, `EMEA`, `APAC`.
- Live currency conversion for `$` amounts, including dynamically rendered content.

## Currency conversion behavior

- Conversion applies only to values that include a leading `$`.
- Converted values are rendered using the selected target currency format.
- Conversion updates as pages re-render.
- Exchange rates are fetched from online APIs and cached locally.
- If fresh rates are unavailable, cached rates are used when possible.

## Install

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable `Developer mode`.
3. Click `Load unpacked`.

## Data and storage

- `chrome.storage.sync` stores feature toggles, retailer name, and selected currency.

## Development notes

- No third-party runtime dependencies.
- Toolbar icons are generated by the background service worker.
